This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the catch-all route ('/*') in React Router v6.  The problem is that the catch-all route fails to render when it should, even when navigating to invalid paths.  The solution provided shows how to fix this issue by ensuring other routes are correctly specified and the catch-all route is placed last within the Routes component.
